# rpwd
## Rust Present Working Directory
I made this while learning Rust.  It took me around five minutes to make.  It's a Rust replacement for the GNU command `pwd`.  It doesn't do anything different, but it's better because it's written in Rust.

I only found out after making it that the code for it is already an example on the Rust website, but whatever.  It's not like I can unmake it.
